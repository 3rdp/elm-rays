This is a fork of raycaster demo from
[elm-rays](https://github.com/krisajenkins/elm-rays) ported from Elm 0.18 to
0.19.

Added **Drawing mode**, you can draw new walls.

You might be interested in checking out this [tutorial](https://github.com/ncase/sight-and-light). It's excellent and it's written in Vanilla JS (versus Elm) and it utilizes Canvas (instead of SVG).
